## Inspiration 
Bringing communities together and uplifting small businesses.
## What it does and how we built it
This website makes information about small businesses in Chicago more accessible. With a back-end of JavaScript and a front-end of HTML with the aid of the Yelp Fusion API, we grabbed the information about the businesses and listed their names. Clicking on a name will show relevant information about the business.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of the features we are proud of are the search on the home screen and the implementation of the API. We are also proud of our adaptability throughout this project. We all ran into bugs at one point or another and were able to figure out a solution, whether by ourselves or with the help of our teammates or mentors.
## What's next for the Kelp
There are many features we would like to implement into the website. Some of them include adding the ability to add businesses to their favorites, having the user able to follow businesses and donate to them to support them, and allowing businesses to post deals and such on the website as an exclusive for their followers, among many, many more!
